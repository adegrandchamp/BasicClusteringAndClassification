# BasicClusteringAndClassification
First machine learning clustering and classification attempts, using k-means and SVM algorithms

This R markdown document showcases an initial attempt at both clustering and classifying a simple dataset. The notebook contains code for both a k-means algorithm (R stats package) and a simple support vector machine classifier (from the caret package). The k-means clusterer is meant to explore patterns among a hypothetical company's customer base, while the SVM classifier is used to return a binary identifying catalog purchasers versus customers who prefer other purchasing methods. 

This document is intended to showcase my qualitative as well as the quantitative approach to answering business questions through machine learning techniques.
